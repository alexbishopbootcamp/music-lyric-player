# Project Description
Lyrynx is a website that can play music from Spotify while displaying the lyrics to the song, as well as informational annotations that reveal the meaning behind the words.

The project utilizes APIs from both Spotify.com and Genius.com in order to achieve this. Tailwind is used as the CSS framework and the site operates as a single page webapp, using Javascript to dynamically update the view.

The project will be conceptualized, designed and built over the course of 2 weeks and will utilize multiple technologies and frameworks including: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind CSS, Github, and Spotify's and Genius's WebAPIs.
